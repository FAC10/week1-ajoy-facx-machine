# FACX Machine's Nice Site

## Why
To create a place where prospective clients can see information about our team, our team members and our work.

## What

+ Navbar
+ Landing/about section
+ Team profiles section
+ Contact form section

## How

+ We began by sitting down as a group to discuss the user stories and design requirements.
+ Given the limited timespan to work on the project we chose a relatively simple layout that would let us focus on writing semantic HTML and ensuring the site is accessible.
+ We discussed CSS layout methods and decided to use flexbox as it allowed us to quickly build a simple responsive grid. Writing our code mobile first meant that we could progressively enhance for users with newer browsers — anyone with a browser without flexbox support would still be able to view the content in the mobile layout.

## Stretch goals

- [ ] Create a fully functional form with [Formspree](http://formspree.io).
- [ ] Nice hover effects for profile links.
- [ ] Possibly some on-load CSS animations
